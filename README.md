# road_safety_exploratory
Exploratory analysis, data wrangling and web scraping for European safety roads data

Here, I extract with web scraping techniques tabular data from Wikipedia's European safety roads webpage.
The script here imports libraries needed, scrapes data and preprocess it to load in csv format

There is also available data tabular package in JSON.
